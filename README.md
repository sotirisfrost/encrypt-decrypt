# Encryption - Decryption

**Author:** Sotiris Gypsiotis  

This Python project for encrypting and decrypting using Caesar Cipher, One-Time Pad (OTP), AES, and RSA algorithms. Automatically generates keys for RSA if not provided.

All `.txt` files must be saved as UTF-8 to avoid including BOM at the beginning of the text. The project was developed using **PyCharm 2024.2.4**, which is an excellent IDE for Python.

## Preparation Installations

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
